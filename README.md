# SDL3 Micro Framework

This is a VERY Simple and small 'Macro-Engine' game engine written in just 3 Days. 

The Reason this was written was for Education. This iswas just a way for me to Dip my toes in 
C++ and SDL3.

## Instalation

While small, you might want to check it out! Please be warned, the following steps only work on Linux:

- Clone Repo `https://github.com/Ethan-Heimer/SDL3MicroFramework`
- Cd into `SDL3MicroFramework`
- Run `./build.sh`

This build script assists the CMakeLists.template file in createing a CMakeLists.txt file that links to all directories in 
the project automaticaly. 

## Whats Included? 

- This 'Micro-Engine' is Composition based, and provies an easy way to create `GameObjects` and add `Components` to them. 
- Provides Scenes to make switching game states easy.

Examples on how to use these can be found in Application.cpp!
